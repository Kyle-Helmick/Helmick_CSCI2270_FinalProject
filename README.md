This repository is where we store our files for our final project.

The game is comprised of multiple cities including the one that you are in charge of. Each city gains 5 resources every two seconds, resources will be calculated at the end of a while loop (dictated by the time it takes for the while loop to cycle through once) and used to either fortify a city or attack an adjacent one, kind of like risk but unlimited resources. The goal is to spread your control by taking over cities adjacent to you but not all cities are adjacent, specific paths must be takenn. Enemy cities will hopefully be able to attack back on their own. Each time the map is random, saving and resuming is a last priority.
