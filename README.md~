# Helmick_Stevenson_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This repository is where we store our files for our final project.

Our Final Project is a game where you control a city in a randomized map (graph). The goal of the game is to control all cities, much like the game RISK. The player can either Attack, Fortify Defenses, Fortify Attack, Wait for more resources, or Manage Resources. An action takes up an entire turn so you must be strategic in decisions. The game also implements a sort of AI that is based off of a predetermined aggression and random weighted choices.

To run the game first cd to the directory that contains the folder titled 'Game', README.md, RunGame, and test.txt in a terminal. Then enter the command './RunGame'.

There are no special dependencies other than the class files included in the project.

So far the program has only been tested on Linux (xubuntu and Ubuntu), testing on other machines would be pretty awesome.
